# XSS Demonstration
A live demo of how XSS attacks could work in real scenarios.

There weren't really any good demos of how XSS works online, so I decided to make one.

## Accessing the demo

Visit my website at [xss.benstafford.dev](https://xss.benstafford.dev) to see the demo.

All details are on the site. The rest of the files here are only supporting files to run the site and the demos.
