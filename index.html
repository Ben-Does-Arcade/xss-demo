            <h1>XSS Demo</h1>
            <p>This site demonstrates the power of the XSS attack when it can be run on an online service.</p>
            <p>Several attack methods are included here, so you can get an idea for how each one works.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Attack 1</h2>
            <p>
                <code>attack1.html</code> simulates a situation in which the URL path parameters can be abused to inject
                arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code can be executed directly on the user's machine.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                Suppose you have a page where you wish to display the user's name using a path parameter. During normal
                use, this URL could look something like this:
            </p>
            <a class="url-try" target="_blank" href="attack1.html?username=John%20Smith">Try &rarr;</a>
            <code>
                https://xss.benstafford.dev/attack1.html?username=John%20Smith
            </code>
            <p>
                Let's also suppose the page in which the endpoint is located is <i>not</i> sanitizing data in this field
                and, therefore, places the path parameter's content directly into the page. This is not good!
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, one can take advantage of this. Remember that any payload into this field must be URI encoded
                first before sending it as otherwise the HTTP request to the site is deemed syntactically invalid.
